        "## Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of an LLM\n",
        "\n",
        "Recall that creating a ChatGPT at home involves 3 steps: (see [Karpathy's State of GPT](https://youtu.be/bZQun8Y4L2A?si=Xei-QdscjdGMCcYP))\n",
        "\n",
        "1. pre-training a large language model (LLM) to predict the next token on internet-scale data, on clusters of thousands of GPUs. One calls the result a \"base model\"\n",
        "2. supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to turn the base model into a useful assistant\n",
        "3. human preference fine-tuning which increases the assistant's friendliness, helpfulness and safety.\n",
        "\n",
        "![sft image](./GPT_Assistant_training_pipeline_2.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we're going to illustrate step 2. This involves supervised fine-tuning (SFT for short), also called instruction tuning.\n",
        "\n",
        "Supervised fine-tuning takes in a \"base model\" from step 1, i.e. a model that has been pre-trained on predicting the next token on internet text, and turns it into a \"chatbot\"/\"assistant\". This is done by fine-tuning the model on human instruction data, using the cross-entropy loss. This means that the model is still trained to predict the next token, although we now want the model to generate useful completions given an instruction like \"what are 10 things to do in London?\", \"How can I make pancakes?\" or \"Write me a poem about elephants\".\n",
        "\n",
        "To do this, one requires human annotators to collect useful completions, on which we can train the model. OpenAI for instance [hired human contractors for this](https://gizmodo.com/chatgpt-openai-ai-contractors-15-dollars-per-hour-1850415474), which were asked to generate useful completions given instructions, like \"In London, you can visit the Big Ben and (...)\". A nice collection of openly available SFT datasets can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/collections/HuggingFaceH4/awesome-sft-datasets-65788b571bf8e371c4e4241a).\n",
        "\n",
        "This way, the model becomes more useful: rather than simply predicting the next token (which might give undesirable outputs, like generating follow-up questions rather than answering the question), we now make it more likely that the model will output useful completions for any instruction we give it. We basically steer it in the direction of generating useful completions which a human could have written given any instruction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Notes:\n",
        "\n",
        "* the entire notebook is based on and can be seen as an annotated version of the [Alignment Handbook](https://github.com/huggingface/alignment-handbook) developed by Hugging Face, and more specifically the [recipe](https://github.com/huggingface/alignment-handbook/blob/main/recipes/zephyr-7b-beta/sft/config_lora.yaml) used to train Zephyr-7b-beta. Huge kudos to the team for creating this!\n",

            "Introduction:\n",
            "Green spaces within urban communities can have significant impacts on the mental health of residents. Several studies have investigated the relationship between green spaces and mental health outcomes such as decreased depression, anxiety, negative mood, and stress. However, examining the availability and quality of urban green spaces is essential to understanding the relationship between urban green spaces and mental health outcomes.\n",
            "\n",
            "Availability and Quality of Urban Green Spaces:\n",
            "The availability of urban green spaces is determined by various factors ranging from the size, shape, and location of parks within close proximity of residents to the maintenance and upkeep of these areas. Urban green spaces that are adequately maintained, open throughout the year, and accessible for all residents have a higher likelihood of being used frequently, thus promoting mental health outcomes.\n",
            "\n",
            "Quality of urban green spaces is assessed by factors such as their design, amenities, and recreational features available to residents. Urban green spaces that have walking/biking paths, playgrounds, benches, and picnic areas tend to have higher levels of utilization and lead to increased mental health outcomes in comparison to spaces that lack such features. The quality of the urban green spaces is crucial since residents' levels of use are often tied to how enjoyable or interesting the spaces are to them.\n",
            "\n",
            "Level of Use, Accessibility, and Connectivity:\n",
            "Urban green spaces' impact on mental health outcomes can only be fully understood through an analysis of the level of use, accessibility, and connectivity. The higher the level of use of the green spaces by residents around the community, the better it is for their mental health, as these spaces provide opportunities for physical activity, relaxation, and social interaction, inevitably leading to improved mental health outcomes. Similarly, the possibility of accessing urban green spaces can result in increased levels of physical activity and reduced stress levels.\n",
            "\n",
            "Connectivity is another crucial factor in enhancing green spaces' mental health impacts. Urban green spaces that are connected to other green spaces through walkways, bicycle paths, or train transport systems can encourage alder adults' physical activity and facilitate spending time in different areas, thus increasing the usage rate of these green spaces.\n",
            "\n",
            "Potential Moderating Effects of Socio-Demographic Variables:\n",
            "Socio-demographic variables, such as age, gender, socioeconomic status, and race, are essential determinants of residents' response to urban green spaces' availability and quality. For instance, research has shown that the elderly have higher rates of utilization of urban green spaces, suggesting that green spaces play a critical role in their mental health outcomes. Similarly, socioeconomic status can affect residents' access to green spaces and their ability to use them.\n",
            "\n",
            "Potential Mechanisms through which Green Spaces Promote Mental Health:\n",
            "Various potential mechanisms have been identified as contributing to urban green spaces' mental health impacts. Some studies have suggested that access to urban green spaces can reduce stress and promote emotional wellbeing. Others have highlighted the contribution of urban green spaces to physical activity, social cohesion, a sense of place, improved sleep, and better air quality.\n",
            "\n",
            "Implications for Policy and Practice:\n",
            "Urban planning policies should prioritize the development and maintenance of high-quality urban green spaces within a reasonable distance from residents. Changes can be made to park management strategies, adapting to changing urban residents' needs, such as providing more recreational amenities and walking paths.\n",
            "\n",
            "Public health promotion can encourage residents to leverage the available urban green spaces to improve their mental health outcomes by investing in targeted campaigns. The provision of additional counseling or therapy can help residents with anxiety or depression to engage in these public spaces without fear.\n",
            "\n",
            "Conclusion:\n",
            "Urban green spaces are valuable community resources that can provide critical mental health benefits for urban residents. Strategies like improving the quality and connectivity of the green spaces, increasing awareness, and making them more accessible to all can enhance their positive effects, making urban green spaces a vital investment for communities.</s>\n",

            "<|assistant|>\n",
            "Sure, I can provide more information on how social cohesion and sense of place contribute to the mental health outcomes of urban residents in relation to urban green spaces. Social Cohesion:\n",
            "Social cohesion refers to the extent to which individuals feel connected to their community and have positive relationships with others in the community. In urban areas, green spaces are valuable places for social interaction and can foster shared activities, leading to social cohesion. The presence of green spaces within the community can encourage shared activities, leading to increased chances of social interaction and interpersonal relationships. The sense of community and social networks obtained from these interactions can lead to a sense of belonging that is beneficial for residents' mental health. Additionally, social cohesion can provide a platform for social support networks that are essential in cases of stress or illness. Sense of Place:\n",
            "Sense of place can be defined as personal and emotional connections that people make with their environment. Studies have indicated that people who have a strong sense of place report higher levels of attachment, satisfaction, and wellbeing than those who lack those feelings. Green spaces provide a setting that facilitates the development of a sense of place by promoting opportunities for residents to connect emotionally with their environment in a way that is significant to them, such as personal attachment to parks, wildlife or landscape features of the green spaces. The emotional connections with green spaces resulting from the sense of place can lead to mental health benefits, such as better mood, decreased stress, and improved self-esteem. Personal connections to green spaces can evoke feelings of safety, comfort, and personal identity, creating a sense of attachment to it, and instilling a sense of pride in the community. In conclusion, social cohesion and sense of place are essential factors that contribute to mental health outcomes, and urban green spaces provide the ideal settings to facilitate their development. Green spaces can act as meeting places, promote shared activities and opportunities to build social support networks that enable social cohesion. Furthermore, the emotional connections created by a sense of place can positively affect residents' mental health by providing a feeling of security or personal identity. As such, it is essential for urban planning policies to prioritize the development and maintenance of urban green spaces as a way of encouraging social cohesion and the development of a sense of place within urban communities.</s>\n",

        "Typically, one performs \"full fine-tuning\": this means that we will simply update all the weights of the base model during fine-tuning. This is then typically done either in full precision (float32), or mixed precision (a combination of float32 and float16). However, with ever larger models like LLMs, this becomes infeasible.\n",

Hence, for a 7 billion parameter model like Mistral-7B, one requires 7 billion parameters \\* 4 bytes per parameter = 28 GB of GPU RAM, just to load the model. During training with an optimizer like AdamW, one not only requires memory for the model but also for the gradients and optimizer states, which roughly comes down to approximately 18 times the size of the model in gigabytes when training with mixed precision, in this case 7 * 18 = 126 GB of GPU RAM.

LoRa is available in the [PEFT library](https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/v0.7.1/en/index) by Hugging Face, which also supports various other PEFT methods (but LoRa is the most popular one at the time of writing).\n",

However, there have been new methods developed to shrink the size of a model considerably, to 8 or 4 bits per parameter (we call this [\"quantization\"](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/quantization)). Hence, if we apply LoRa to a quantized model (like a 4-bit model), then we call this QLoRa. We have a [blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/4bit-transformers-bitsandbytes) that tells you all about it.
